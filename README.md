## Our Choice

NODE.JS !

We chose to use Node Js for following reason :

We have little experience in this language, and we want to find new opportunities.

JavaScript has traditionally only run in the web browser, but recently there has been considerable interest in bringing it to the server side as well, thanks to the Node js.

Tools and Node community is in expansion.

It allows to set up a development environment for API-RESTFULL very quickly.

The package management system NPM is fast, robust, and consistent. It does a great job at specifying and installing project dependencies.

Using Node.js allows you to use the same language on the client, on the server, and in the database. You can keep your data in its native JSON format from browser to disk.

If you're using an object database like Mongo, then you can extend JavaScript to the persistence layer as well.

To finish :  Node is trendy at the moment. It is great to impress these friends in a discussion.

## Documentation of the API of the Citizen Engagement

This is a generator that compiles [Markdown][md] and [RAML][raml] files into a
static site. The following [Node.js][node] stack is used:

 - Build tasks using [Grunt][grunt]
 - Content assembling with [Metalsmith][metalsmith]
 - Templating using [Jade][jade]
 - CSS-preprocessing with [Stylus][stylus]
 - Basic styling using [Twitter Bootstrap][bootstrap]

Note that apart from Markdown support within the RAML spec it also supports
plain `.md` files that are compiled independently from the API documentation.
