#### NODE.JS ! :

![nodejs](nodejs.png)

We chose to use Node Js for following reason :

We have little experience in this language, and we want to find new opportunities.

JavaScript has traditionally only run in the web browser, but recently there has been considerable interest in bringing it to the server side as well, thanks to the Node js.

Tools and Node community is in expansion.

It allows to set up a development environment for API-RESTFULL very quickly.

The package management system NPM is fast, robust, and consistent. It does a great job at specifying and installing project dependencies.

Using Node.js allows you to use the same language on the client, on the server, and in the database. You can keep your data in its native JSON format from browser to disk.

If you're using an object database like Mongo, then you can extend JavaScript to the persistence layer as well.

To finish :  Node is trendy at the moment. It is great to impress these friends in a discussion.
